  The only mstack skill that edits code. Consumes an approved review from
  /mstack-review and executes the implementation plan autonomously, one atomic
  commit per task. Pauses on ambiguity (destructive migrations, brand/design
  layer changes, new deps, failing acceptance criteria). Writes a task ledger
  and run log to .mstack/code/<slug>/ so a partial run can be
  resumed by re-invoking on the same review.
  Use when the user says "implement the plan", "run the implementation",
  "code it", or invokes /mstack-code. Errors clearly if no approved review
  exists.

# mstack-code

Execute an approved implementation plan from `/mstack-review`. Autonomous by
default; pauses only when a task hits a real ambiguity. One atomic commit
per task.

**Narration:** one short line per task between tool calls — `tasks.md` and
`log.md` carry the detailed record, not the transcript.

## Resolve project layout

Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/bin/resolve-config.sh`. It prints the
project's resolved `paths`, `commands`, and a `_resolved` block
(`.mstack/config.json` overrides → auto-detected defaults). The keys this
skill uses:

- `commands.typecheck` / `commands.lint` / `commands.test` / `commands.build`
  — run THESE, not a hardcoded `pnpm ...` (e.g. an npm project resolves to
  `npm run typecheck`)
- `paths.webApp` [monorepo default `apps/web`; flat `.`]
- `paths.brandSource` and `conventions.brandStringLiteralRule` — the brand /
  config source and whether to enforce no hardcoded brand strings outside it
- `conventions.serviceLayer`, `conventions.apiPrefix`
- `_resolved.{packageManager,layout,hasMobile}`

**Throughout this skill, treat every `packages/...`, `apps/web/...`,
`src/config/...` path literal — and every `pnpm <script>` command literal —
as the monorepo default. Substitute the resolved `paths.*` / `commands.*`
value for the actual project.** State the detected `layout` and
`packageManager` to the user.

## Pre-flight (must pass before any code edits)

1. **Find the review.** Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/bin/find-latest-review.sh`
   (errors if `.mstack/reviews/` is empty). Show path + first few lines and
   confirm: "Implement this review?" If user passes a path arg, use it instead.

2. **Check review status.** Open the review and verify the frontmatter `Status`
   is `approved`. If not, abort with a message asking the user to finish
   `/mstack-review` first.

3. **Check git state.**
   - Current branch must NOT be `main` or `master`. Abort if it is — ask the
     user to create a feature branch.
   - Working tree must be clean. Abort if dirty — ask the user to commit or
     stash.

4. **Initialise the implementation directory.** Create
   `.mstack/code/<review-slug>/` with:
   - `tasks.md` — task ledger (template below)
   - `log.md` — empty, appended to as the run progresses
   - If the directory already exists with an in-progress `tasks.md`, treat this
     as a **resume**: confirm with the user before continuing.
   - **After compaction or on any resume, trust `tasks.md` + `git log` over
     your own recollection.** A task marked `[x]` is DONE — its commit exists
     in git even if you don't remember creating it. Never re-run it.

5. **Register tasks** with TaskCreate — one task per implementation-plan entry
   from the review. This gives the user live progress visibility.

6. **Contradiction scan.** Read the full task list once before Task 1: do any
   tasks conflict with each other, with the review's locked decisions, or
   with the resolved hard rules? If yes, surface ALL findings in ONE
   AskUserQuestion batch now — never one interrupt per discovery mid-loop.
   If the scan is clean, start without comment.

## Per-task loop

For each task in order:

1. Mark TaskUpdate `in_progress`. Update `tasks.md` to `[~]` for this task.

2. **Read the files involved** before editing — the review's "Files" list is a
   hint, not a complete read. Sibling files often matter too.

3. **Check the Pause if trigger.** If the task lists a `Pause if` condition
   and the situation matches, **pause now** (jump to "Pause handling" below)
   before making edits.

4. **Make the edits.** Follow the task's `What`. Honor the project's hard
   rules, in this order of authority:
   1. **`conventions.hardRules`** from the resolved config — enforce each
      entry verbatim.
   2. Hard rules stated in `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`.
   3. **ORM discipline**, gated on `conventions.orm`:
      - `drizzle` → schema change requires a generated migration
        (`db:generate`); never `db:push`.
      - `prisma` → schema change requires a committed migration
        (`prisma migrate dev --name <slug>`); never `prisma db push`.
      - `none` → skip.
   4. Template defaults — apply ONLY when the project actually uses the
      pattern (check before enforcing):
      - No raw `process.env` / hardcoded brand strings outside
        `paths.brandSource`'s directory — gated on
        `conventions.brandStringLiteralRule`.
      - `import "server-only"` in server-only modules (Next.js projects).
      - Zod at boundaries — if the project already validates with Zod.

5. **Verify acceptance — two named verdicts, both required:**

   **(a) Spec fidelity.** Compare your diff against the task's `What` and
   `Acceptance` fields: nothing missing, nothing extra — no unrequested
   refactors, features, or "improvements". Record `spec: ok` (or the
   deviation) in the task's Notes. A deviation you can't justify against
   the task's `What` is a pause, not a note.

   **(b) Mechanical checks.** Run the relevant ones:
   - If task touched `.ts`/`.tsx` → run `commands.typecheck` [default
     `pnpm typecheck`]
   - If the task changed the DB schema → run the migration-generation command
     for `conventions.orm` (drizzle: `db:generate`; prisma:
     `prisma migrate dev --name <task-slug>`) and confirm a migration file
     was produced
   - If the task's `Acceptance` field references a specific test → run it
   - Do NOT run e2e/Playwright (that's `/mstack-qa`'s job)

6. **If verification fails**, fix once and re-verify. A second failure is
   ambiguity → pause (see below). Never grind retries on the same fix.

7. **Commit.** One commit per task. Message format:

   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <task name>

   Implements task N/M from .mstack/reviews/<slug>.md

   Co-Authored-By: <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>
   ```

   Replace `<model>` with the name of the model you are currently running as
   (e.g. "Claude Fable 5") — never a hardcoded model from this doc.

   Type and scope follow the existing repo convention (look at `git log`).
   **Never bypass hooks** (`--no-verify`). If a hook fails, that's a signal —
   pause and ask the user.

8. Mark TaskUpdate `completed`. Update `tasks.md` to `[x]` with the commit SHA.
   Append a one-line entry to `log.md`.
   If the task completed but you carry a self-flagged doubt (e.g. "migration
   may not be reversible", "typecheck passed but the types feel forced"),
   record it as `Notes: ⚠ concern — <one line>`. Done-with-concerns tasks
   stay `[x]`, but every `⚠` note MUST surface in the final report's
   **Concerns** section — a doubt recorded nowhere is a doubt discarded.

## Pause handling

When a task pauses:

1. Append a detailed entry to `log.md` (what was attempted, what blocked).
2. Update `tasks.md` to `[!]` for this task.
3. Use AskUserQuestion to surface the situation with three options:
   - **Continue with guidance** — user provides a hint, you retry the task
   - **Skip this task** — mark `[-]`, continue to next task
   - **Abort the run** — write the report and stop
4. Record the user's decision in `log.md`.

## Pause-if triggers (defaults — the review can list more)

These always cause a pause, regardless of what the review says:

- Destructive migrations (drop column with data, drop table, type narrowing)
- Edits to `src/config/brand.ts` or `src/config/design.ts` (rebrand layer)
- New top-level deps not pre-approved in the plan or review
- Changes to CI config (`.github/`, `lefthook.yml`)
- Changes to env vars (adding required ones to `.env.example` is fine; renaming
  or removing is a pause)
- Acceptance criterion that turns out unverifiable when you try to write the check

## Final report

When the loop ends (complete, aborted, or all-paused-then-stopped), write
`.mstack/code/<slug>/report.md` with:

- **Status** — complete | partial | aborted
- **Tasks** — table: `✓ done` / `⏸ paused` / `⊘ skipped`, each with commit SHA
  if any
- **Commits** — list with SHAs and one-line messages
- **Follow-ups** — what didn't get done, what needs human attention
- **Concerns** — every `⚠ concern` note from `tasks.md`, verbatim (omit the
  section only if there are none)
- **Recommended next step** — usually `/mstack-qa` with focus area

**Evidence rule:** every `✓ done` row and the report's **Status** line must
be backed by a command run in THIS session (typecheck/test output, commit
SHA) — cite it. Never carry a claim forward from an earlier run, an agent's
self-report, or memory. A claim you can't cite is a claim you re-verify.

Then:

- Update the plan's status from `reviewed` → `implemented` (Edit the plan doc).
- Append learnings (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/bin/append-learning.sh`) for
  anything non-obvious surfaced during the run.
- Capture the leftovers: append every `⏸ paused` / `⊘ skipped` task and each
  **Follow-ups** item to the todo backlog —
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/bin/append-todo.sh "code <slug>" "<item>"`.
  Nothing on the report may exist only in the report.
- Tell the user: "Implementation report at <path>. N commits. Run /mstack-qa
  next."

## tasks.md template (write this in step 4 of pre-flight)

```markdown
# Implementation: <feature>

**Started:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Review:** [<slug>](../../reviews/<slug>.md)
**Branch:** <branch>
**Status:** in_progress

---

## Legend
- `[ ]` pending  ·  `[~]` in_progress  ·  `[x]` done
- `[!]` paused (awaiting decision)  ·  `[-]` skipped

## Tasks

- [ ] **Task 1:** <name>
  - Files: <from review>
  - Commit: —
  - Notes: —

- [ ] **Task 2:** …
```

## Gotchas to watch for

- **After deleting an app-router `page.tsx`,** run `rm -rf <paths.webApp>/.next`
  before `commands.typecheck` [default `pnpm typecheck`]. Stale
  `.next/types/validator.ts` files import the now-missing `page.js` and `tsc`
  fails until `.next` is cleared. Only applies to Next.js web apps.

## Red flags — you are rationalizing

If you catch yourself thinking any of these, STOP — the right column is the
rule you're about to break:

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll `--no-verify` just this once — the hook failure is unrelated" | Hook failures are signals, unrelated-looking ones most of all. Pause and ask. |
| "These two tasks are tiny, one commit saves time" | Atomic commits ARE the deliverable — the ledger and PR narrative depend on 1:1 task↔commit. |
| "One more retry will fix the verification" | One retry max. A second failure is information for a human, not a puzzle for you. |
| "This edit isn't *really* destructive / doesn't *really* touch the rebrand layer" | If you're arguing about whether a Pause-if trigger matches, it matches. Pause. |
| "The change is trivial — typecheck can wait until the end" | Per-task verification is what makes a paused run resumable. Run it now. |
| "I remember what this file looks like" | Files change between tasks. Read before editing, every task. |
| "`--amend` keeps history clean" | Amend rewrites the previous task's commit. New commit, always. |

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't run e2e/Playwright tests.** That's `/mstack-qa`'s job.
- **Don't bypass hooks.** `--no-verify` is forbidden. Hook failures are
  signals — pause.
- **Don't amend commits across tasks.** Each task = one new commit. Pre-commit
  hook failure → fix and create a NEW commit, not `--amend` (the previous
  task's commit must stay intact).
- **Don't batch tasks into one commit** to "save time." Atomic commits are the
  whole point — they're how the review surface stays useful.
- **Don't push.** This skill creates commits locally only. Pushing is the
  user's call (or a future `/mstack-ship`).
- **Don't loop on a failing verification.** One retry max, then pause.
- **Don't skip the resume check.** If `.mstack/code/<slug>/` exists
  with in-progress tasks, ask before clobbering or resuming.
